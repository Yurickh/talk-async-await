# Async-await lightning talk
The point of this lightning talk was to demystify the use of async-await in javascript for the novatics team.

This is support material for a lightning talk, so don't expect to get what is happening right away. But I might add some comments to the code to make it more intelligible.

I used this code with [Atom](https://atom.io) and [Quokka](https://atom.io/packages/atom-quokka), which explains why most `console.log`s are on their own lines.
